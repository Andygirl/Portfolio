	<h3>Hi!  I'm Andy, and I love building websites and learning to code.</h3>
	<p>I design, redesign, edit, market, update, and maintain websites using WordPress, Weebly, Squarespace, and Shopify.  I write copy for clients on their pages, blogs, and social media outlets.  I am also an SEO and social media expert.  I enjoy the technical and design aspect of creating websites and getting customers to those websites.  I have great relationships with clients and believe that communication is key to us achieving our goals together.</p>
	<p>When I'm not learning, coding, and playing with websites, I am out hiking with my husband and dog, working out, or voraciously reading books on my Kindle.  (My husband calls my Kindle "the other man")</p>

He wanted something simple, clean, and readable for his prospective clients to look him up online.  I kept a blog page open for him in case he wants to start one as well.</p>
